# Pediatric immune microenvironment profiling
## scRNAseq profiling of pediatric glioma-associated immune cells across 6 glioma subtypes

Brief description of main folders (see detailed README in subdirectories for more info):

*TumorCellAnnotation/*: Processing and annotating tumor cells separately for each subtype

*ImmuneCellAnalysis/*: Main project folder. Contains all Tcell, myeloid analysis as well as integration across tumor/immune cells

*PD1_Treat/*: Currently not used for this project, but may incoporate. Analysis of PD-1 treated patient single cell data

*FACS/*: Processing and plotting of FACS data to show proportion of tumor/myeloid/tcell present in patient samples

*PTGER2_Sort/*: Currently not used for this project. Attempt at sorting fresh patient tissue for PTGER2 followed by scRNAseq.
