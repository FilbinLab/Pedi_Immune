InferCNV notes

As of 5/6/21, the process for calling malig cells (WITHOUT new samples) is as follows:

1. inferCNV run for all samples (without 2 new samples) simultaneously
2. Number of cells to consider HC cluster as "normal" set at 5
3. Sample BT1478 manually set as having CNVs- basically entire sample lacks CNVs, would all be called normal otherwise.
4. Seurat clustering performed (28 PCs, 0.6 resolution)
5. Clusters 6 and 21 are clearly normal- based on markers, ref cell presence. Cluster 17 is very close to 6, and has normal OC markers, but unclear if normal or malig
6. inferCNV run separately for cluster 17, which contains samples: MUV78/79/91/86/87. Clear CNVs for 78/79, likely for 91, hard to tell for 86/87. Most cells are MUV79/86
7. UMAP saved zooming in on cluster 17/6, showing where samples are. Cluster 17 is split into a "top" (mostly muv86) and "bottom" (mostly Muv79)
8. Cluster 17 considered "malignant" for now (for inferCNV seurat clustering). Likely that top half is normal, bottom half is malignant
9. MUV86 is midline histone mut. While annotating separately for this subtype downstream, see clear cluseter (cluster6) VERY far from others, OC-like
10. This cluster appears to be normal- it consists mostly (entirely?) of cells from the top half of inferCNV cluster 17
11. Cells in cluster 6 for midline histone mut samples removed as "normal" manually

All of this was confirmed by re-running inferCNV process to replicate original analysis, which had become a little unclear over time
inferCNV_replicate folders contain these figures/analyses. Not used downstream, as it was confirmed that original analysis/replicate analysis (following above steps) matched exactly


As of 5/6/21, the process for calling malig cells (WITH new samples) is as follows:

1. inferCNV run for all samples (including 2 new samples) simultaneously
2. Number of cells to consider HC cluster as "normal" set at 9. This gave results most comparable to original analysis (98% match)
3. Sample BT1478 manually set as having CNVs
4. Seurat clustering performed (28 PCs, 0.6 resolution)
5. Clusters 6 and 23 are clearly normal- based on markers, ref cell presence. Cluster 16 is very close to 6, and has normal OC markers, but unclear if normal or malig
6. Did not run inferCNV on cluster 16 alone as was done for cluster 17 in the previous analysis- assumed same situation
7. UMAP saved zooming in on cluster 16/6, shwoing where samples are. Again cluster 16 is split into a top/bottom half
8. Cluster 16 considered "malignant" for now (for inferCNV seurat clustering). Likely that top half is normal, bottom half is malignant

Overall, there is a 98% match in annotations between the 2 analyses (with and without the new samples). 
This discrepancy is spread over 11 samples, with the max # of cells differing being 19 cells in BT1733
All of this discrepancy is due to differences in HC, not seurat clustering
1 cell went from noise --> normal, majority (80%) went from malig --> noise/normal

Moving forward: original annotations used for original samples, new annotation used for 2 new samples
The discrepancy is minor, especially at the sample level (all less than 20 cells different, most less than 10).
The new annotations for the 2 new samples will be integrated into the old annotations for their respective cell types in the SubtypesSplit folder
i.e.- new annotation for BT1873 will be added to midline histone mut tumor_stat annotations
