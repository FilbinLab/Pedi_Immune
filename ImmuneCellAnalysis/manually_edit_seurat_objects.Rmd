Various manual edits to annotations for seurat objects made here. Rather than edit individual scripts, these minor edits are made here and files saved. Then figures regenerated using corrected annotations.

```{r}
base_dir = "/Users/jlabelle/"
script_dir = "Dropbox (Partners HealthCare)/FilbinLab/data_analysis/Scripts/"
working_dir<- paste0(base_dir, 
                     "Dropbox (Partners HealthCare)/FilbinLab/",
                     "data_analysis/Projects/git_repos/Pedi_Immune/ImmuneCellAnalysis/")


```

To be corrected:
BT1478 not BCOR
NMF annotations- stress response --> microglia; inhibitory --> "activated EM" maybe?
