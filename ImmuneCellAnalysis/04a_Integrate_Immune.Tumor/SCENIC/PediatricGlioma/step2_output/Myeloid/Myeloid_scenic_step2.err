2022-10-21 14:23:53,718 - pyscenic.utils - WARNING - Note on correlation calculation: the default behaviour for calculating the correlations has changed after pySCENIC verion 0.9.16. Previously, the default was to calculate the correlation between a TF and target gene using only cells with non-zero expression values (mask_dropouts=True). The current default is now to use all cells to match the behavior of the R verision of SCENIC. The original settings can be retained by setting 'rho_mask_dropouts=True' in the modules_from_adjacencies function, or '--mask_dropouts' from the CLI.
	Dropout masking is currently set to [False].
